# RSAbrk
 I enjoyed playing with math to come up with this 😁...

This program is about factoring a PQ product where P and Q are both prime numbers.
As a result i got 124520438789 = 128819 * 966631 with P=128819 and Q=966631 within 17 seconds 👀 (result obtained with RSAbrk_v2).
RSAbrk_v1 took me almost 13 minutes just to tell me "no factors found" 😅😂😂 (that's probably due to the precision i used).
