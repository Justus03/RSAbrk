# RSAbrk (ignore this repo)
I enjoyed playing with math to come up with this !

This program is about factoring a PQ product where P and Q are both prime numbers. I've got P=128819 and Q=966631 for the product PQ = 124520438789 within 17 seconds (obtained with RSAbrk_v2). RSAbrk_v1 took me almost 13 minutes just to tell me "no factors found" ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ (that's probably due to the precision I used).

# Note:
I love math, so I did this program just for entertainment. I plan to come up with an RSAbrk_v3 version where I will use GMP and MPFR to allow factoring larger PQ products (the libraries I used in RSAbrk_v2 and RSAbrk_v1 don't handle very large numbers).
